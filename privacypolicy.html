<h4>1. INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p class="cnt">This Privacy Policy applies when you use any of the Apps of this publisher and should be read together with the End User License Agreement EULA. By using a Publisher&rsquo;s App, you are consenting to our processing of your information in ways set out in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with it, please do not use any Publisher&rsquo;s Apps. In certain cases, for example, if geolocation data is processed by the relevant Publisher&rsquo;s App, the Publisher&rsquo;s App will prompt you to give additional consent. In such case, you can choose not to give consent to us processing data related to your location but you can still use the Publisher&rsquo;s App. This Privacy Policy may change so you should review it regularly. We will notify you of any material changes in the way we treat your information through the Publisher&rsquo;s Apps you use.</p>
<h4>2. DATA WE COLLECT</h4>
<p class="cnt">When you use an Publisher&rsquo;s App, Publisher may collect data, including information which directly or indirectly identifies you. Your information may be kept in an identifiable format, or in an aggregate format which means that you cannot reasonably be identified from it. The information we collect about you includes: If an Publisher&rsquo;s App offers you the option to register, we will collect the information you provide to us in the registration form. This may include identification data such as your name, email address or other account or registration information.</p>
<p class="cnt">We will also collect your information when you use Publisher&rsquo;s Apps such as when you post or share material, upload data, request further services or make selections using the Publisher&rsquo;s Apps, if such functionality is available in the Publisher&rsquo;s App.</p>
<p class="cnt">We will collect information about you when you interact with us such as when you report a problem, contact or communicate with us. We may collect certain device information and electronic identifiers such as your mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device operating system, your mobile operating system details and the name of your mobile carrier. For example, if you use the iOS platform then Advertiser IDs (also known as &ldquo;IDFAs&rdquo;) may be collected. Other identifiers collected may include IP addresses, OpenUDID, Session ID, ODIn1, iOS Vendor IDs, MAC addresses, IMEI, Android ID for Android platform, and ODIN1 for OS X (together with the IDFAs, the &ldquo;App Identifiers&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="cnt">Information about how and when you use the Publisher&rsquo;s App. This includes the amount of times you used the Publisher&rsquo;s App, which parts of it you viewed and other technical data such as country settings and timestamps.</p>
<p class="cnt">Geolocation data, which is any information which indicates the geographical position of your device and which may include the time the location was recorded. Before processing any precise GPS geolocation data, the Publisher&rsquo;s App will require you to give your consent, which you can revoke by changing the privacy settings of your device.</p>
<p class="cnt">Any of your information you provide or permit to be provided to us via a social network or public forum provider like Facebook when you link the Publisher&rsquo;s App to your social network or public forum account. This data may include your use of the Publisher&rsquo;s App on such public forums and/or social networks, including with whom you share the Publisher&rsquo;s App. For further information how and for what purpose the social network provider collects etc. your data see their privacy policy. We automatically collect certain information from your device when you use the Publisher&rsquo;s App including information about your device, carrier and other technical data.</p>
<h4>3. ONLINE TRACKING AND OPT-OUT</h4>
<p class="cnt">We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected from you on our Publisher&rsquo;s Apps for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the links below to the NAI &ldquo;Consumer Opt-out,&rdquo; DAA opt-out, and Google and other opt-outs that are only applicable to participating third parties, which does not include Publisher. As stated below you may also block certain App Identifiers by changing the settings of your device. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.</p>

If you do not wish to receive in-application advertising, you can upgrade to the paid version of the app.;</p>
<p class="cnt">- Develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests and to measure its effectiveness;</p>
<p class="cnt">- Verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and sweepstakes and in order to conduct polls and surveys;</p>
<p class="cnt">- Enforce our terms, conditions and policies and to communicate with you;</p>

When you use the Publisher&rsquo;s App, we may use the App Identifiers to facilitate access to the Publisher&rsquo;s Apps, help us recognize you across different Publisher&rsquo;s Apps, to enable you to use the Publisher&rsquo;s Apps, to personalize your experience, to increase security, measure the use and effectiveness of our Publisher&rsquo;s Apps and serve advertising. You can block certain App Identifiers by changing the settings of your device.</p>
<h4>5. CROSS-APP ADVERTISING AND OTHER INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING TECHNOLOGIES</h4>
<p class="cnt">As described above, we sometimes work with third parties to deliver ads, content or offers. Sometimes we or these third parties do so through a mobile &ldquo;SDK.&rdquo; The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented. We may use this and similar technology to deliver certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on data associated with your mobile device, and we may work with third parties who likewise embed their SDKs into our apps, for third party advertising. If you&rsquo;d like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions below.</p>
<p class="cnt">If you wish to opt out of interest-based cross-application tracking through your mobile device, you can do so through your device &ldquo;settings&rdquo;, as follows (but please note that the below is for informational purposes only and Apple, Google, or other device platforms may change the manner in which their &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; settings work at any time).</p>
<p class="cnt">Please note that if you opt out through these settings, you will continue to receive advertising after you opt-out, but it may not be tailored to your interests. For instance, that advertising may be based on your real-time or &ldquo;contextual&rdquo; application usage or general location inferred from IP address.</p>
<p class="cnt">Opting Out on iOS Devices Such as iPhones, iPads or iPods</p>
<p class="cnt">If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of mobile interest-based or &ldquo;cross-app&rdquo; advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher, and setting Limit Ad Tracking to &lsquo;ON&rsquo;. On an iPhone 6 for example, you can do this by clicking on Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Advertising and toggling &ldquo;Limit Ad Tracking&rdquo; to &lsquo;ON&rsquo;. Our systems are designed to respect your choice and not use Information to provide interest-based advertising when this setting is ON.</p>
<p class="cnt">We may sometimes work with partners to help us or help them correlate content or ads provided to users across devices or browsers. For instance, a brand may wish to use the Information that we collect (or data that its own partners collect) to send offers to its customers across both mobile applications and browsers. We thus also provide the links below to the NAI &ldquo;Consumer Opt-out,&rdquo; DAA opt-out, and Google opt-out that are only applicable to participating third parties, which does not include IAC. You may also block certain App Identifiers by changing the settings of your device. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry has not reached a consensus as to Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.</p>
